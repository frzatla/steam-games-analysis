    "\n",
    "The video game industry has always been a multi-billion dollar market, and Steam stands as its most dominant PC storefront. As a lifelong gamer, I have always been fascinated by the sheer volume of titles released yearly. Ranging from solo-developed Indie gems to massive AAA titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the marketplace is crowded. For every masterpiece, thousands of games go unnoticed. This project aims to move beyond subjective opinion and use data to understand what drives success on the platform. By analyzing pricing strategies, genre trends, and review sentiment, I aim to uncover the quantitative patterns that separate a game from being a success.. or a flop."
